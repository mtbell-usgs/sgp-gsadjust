The development branch of GSadjust, with bugfixes and other improvements, is at https://github.com/jkennedy-usgs/sgp-gsadjust

# GSadjust
GSadjust is a cross-platform graphical interface for processing relative gravity surveys. It provides an interface for data selection, drift evaluation and correction, network adjustment, and integrating data from modern relative (Scintrex, ZLS) and absolute (Micro-g Lacoste) gravity meters. This software is a product of the USGS Southwest Gravity Program (http://go.usa.gov/xqBnQ).

GSadjust is public-domain software written for Python 3.5 and the PyQt5 framework. Although basic functionality has been tested on Mac and Linux machines, there may be unknown issues on those operating systems. 

Bug reports by email (jkennedy@usgs.gov) or by submitting an issue through GitHub are welcome.

**Installing GSadjust**

The easiest, most reliable way to install GSadjust is by using Conda to create a custom Python environment:

1. Download and install the appropriate Miniconda installer for your platform (Windows, Mac, Linux):
[https://conda.io/miniconda.html](https://conda.io/miniconda.html "Miniconda download")
(Any Python version (e.g., 2.7 or 3.6) is okay)

2. Open a command window or terminal and create a new conda environment:

    ```
    $> conda create -n pyg35 python=3.5 numpy scipy=0.19 pyqt=5 networkx matplotlib pywin32 git
    ```

    This creates a new conda environment named pyg35 with the appropriate modules and versions. 

3. Activate the new python environment:

    ```
    $> activate pyg35
    ```

4. Navigate to the file location you'd like to create a GSadjust directory and pull the most recent GSadjust code:

    ```
    (pyg35) $> git clone https://github.com/jkennedy-usgs/GSadjust
    ```

5. Run GSadjust:

    ```
    (pyg35) $> python GSadjust/main_code/GSadjust.py
    ```

## Data selection interface
* Select/deselect samples and stations
* Plot gravity, earth tide correction, tilt, etc.
* Imports both Scintrex and Burris data formats

## Drift correction
* Allows for Roman (1946) method, continuous drift correction (Kennedy and Ferre, 2016, doi: 10.1093/gji/ggv493), or determined from least-squares solution
* Graphical interface shows drift rate vs. time

## Network adjustment
* Individual delta-g's can be enabled/diabled
* Uses numpy or Gravnet (Hwang and others, 2002) for network adjustment
* Import absolute-gravity data directly from .project.txt files
* Adjustment diagnostics: residual histogram, measured vs. adjusted, etc.

For convenience GSadjust is distributed with a Windows executable for Gravnet software (Hwang and others, 2002; not to be confused with Gravnet software used by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency). USGS assumes no responsibility for the accuracy of the network-adjustment results generated by Gravnet.
